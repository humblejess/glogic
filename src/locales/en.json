Some people think gender is as clear as length or time, which should be physically or medically clear. Sure, let's discuss it. Some people think it's clear like 0 or 1. I would say it's more like day and night. Yes, it's crystal clear. No one will be confused about whether it's day or night. But what about dawn and dusk? Can you tell me which second is day and which second is night now?",

    "content": "No matter what political view or religious opinion, transgender people are human beings. You cannot say they don't belong to human. If you agree they are human, then we have to face their gender identity. Even if people may think a. DNA and Chromosomes or b. Congenital Reproductive Organs (sex assigned at birth) should be the most decisive factor to identify gender, but in reality, they can only decide one's gender by d. Secondary Sexual Characteristics or e. Gender Expression. Furthermore, even if one chooses c. Current Reproductive Organs as the most important factor, they have no way to check it in many social realities. They still judge people's gender by option d and e, unless one's secondary sexual characteristics are contradictory. But that can't be a rule, right?"

    "content": "In the real world, many transgender people are facing big challenges from many places, like struggling with their assigned sex, acceptance from family members and friends, challenges from work and school, being beaten or committing suicide, etc. These are the majority of transgender people. The discrimination they experience far outweighs the benefits they gain from this status. Indeed, the situation of minors and sports is worthy of further discussion, but we need to think logically and reflect on the cognition of gender first. I am here to wish these trans people and anyone with gender dysphoria, peace and happiness.",
